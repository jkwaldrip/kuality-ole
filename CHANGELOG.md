- Created localization options for Kuality OLE, configured in config/institutional/localization.yml.
- Split gem_ext into tf_ext (TestFactory extensions) and watir_ext (Watir-Webdriver extensions).
- TestFactory Extensions
    - Data Object
        - Added #autofill and #autofill_params to better support line_elements/values/actions.
            - Both methods look for instance variables ONLY, they do not parse opts.
    - Page Object
        - Implemented dynamic callbacks to provide multiple, callback-based definitions for line objects.
            - See #line_element and lib/kuality_ole/callbacks.rb
        - Implemented #wait_until_loaded/#wait_till_loaded on Page classes.
            - Calls wait_for_ajax on page to ensure all ajax activity has stopped.
            - Waits for all elements registered (with .wait_on in page definition) to be present.
- Watir-Webdriver Extensions
    - Added #get_selected_text & #get_selected_value.
    - Modified #select_by to wait for value to exist before attempting to select it.
    - Modified #fit (from TestFactory gem extensions) to try selecting by value or by text.
- Updated Marc-related pages to use proper TestFactory element naming conventions (i.e., no field, selector, &c.)
- Now requires TestFactory 0.5.1, for improved #fit support.
- Fixed definitions of tabs on BasePage, registered all tabs with .wait_on in PortalPage.
- Created Patron data object.
- Created Patron pages.
- Separated Helpers module into Helpers (for use in Cucumber as well as Data/Info objects) & DataHelpers (for Data & Info objects).
- Renamed MarcRecord to Resource, MarcGroup to ResourceGroup.

- MarcBib.to_mrc now returns the Ruby-Marc formatted record instead of true.
- MarcRecord now has a .to_mrc method which returns the contained bib as a Ruby-Marc record.
- Created MarcGroup class to serve as a container for read/write of multiple records to/from
  a Marc (.mrc) file.
  - Records can be added manually and written to a file.
  - Records can be instantiated from a file by giving the filepath.
